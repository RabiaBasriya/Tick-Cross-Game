# Tick-Cross-Game
 ## About the Game
 Hello! This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It is a classic two-player game that you can play on the same computer. One player will use 'X' and the other will use 'O'. The goal is to place three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does. If the board is full and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
 ## How to Play
- Run the program in any C++ compiler.
- The game will display a 3x3 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 representing each position on the board.
- Player 1 (X) starts first and selects a number to place their 'X' on the board.
- Player 2 (O) takes the next turn and selects a number to place their 'O'.
- The game continues until one player successfully forms a row, column, or diagonal with their marks.
- If a player wins, the game announces the winner.
- If all the positions are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
